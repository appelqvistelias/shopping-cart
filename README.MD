## Shopping Cart Functionality in OOPHP

This project implements shopping cart functionality using a `.json` file as the inventory source. The primary objective is to enhance my understanding of Object-Oriented PHP (OOPHP) principles and practices.

For future improvements, replacing the `.json` file with a database would be a simple enhancement. Please note that the prices included are fictional and intended solely for testing purposes.

Additionally, the project uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for dependency management.
