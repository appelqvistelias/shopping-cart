## Shopping Cart Functionality in OOPHP  

This project implements shopping cart functionality using a `.json` file as an inventory source. The primary goal is to deepen my understanding of Object-Oriented PHP (OOPHP).

For those interested, replacing the `.json` file with a database should be a straightforward enhancement.

The project also utilizes [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for dependency management.
